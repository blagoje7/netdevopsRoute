# If there is a list of information you would like to collect and use in your script
# Then list is probably right approach

# eg
# List of ip addresses

# List of pairing endpoint and ip addresses
# Dictionary is probably answer here
# ie. when planning to search for specific element

# any immutable type is ok for keys  as dictionaries (Numbers, Boolean, Strings, Tuples)
# on the flip side, values can be any type, even other dictionaries

# Usernames and groups they belong to

# if list has 10 elements checking if element is inside is really fast
# if there is 10,000 not so much



# There is one more data type

# Set
# used when we want to store list of elements and be certain they will only be present once
# Elements of a set must also be immutable
