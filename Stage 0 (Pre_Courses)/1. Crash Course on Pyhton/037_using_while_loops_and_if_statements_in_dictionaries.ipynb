    "Dictionaries are used to organize elements into collections using pairs of keys and values. But what do you do when you need to search a collection of `data` for a `value`? That’s where while loops come in. A while loop will iterate through conditions until one comes up False, unlike a for loop, which will iterate through the entire dictionary, one row at a time. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">for item in someDictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    ">   <code goes here>\n",
    "\n",
    "versus:\n",
    "\n",
    ">while someDictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    ">    <code goes here>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the for loop, the while loop does not require calling a variable to act as a counter, or the “item” variable in the for loop. for loops anticipate a specific structure—like a list—and when called, will iterate through the entire list, until it gets to the end.  while loops can be used more universally when the structure of your data set is more ambiguous.
