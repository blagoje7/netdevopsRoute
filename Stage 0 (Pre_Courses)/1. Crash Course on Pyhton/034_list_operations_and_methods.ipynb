    "\n",
    "- `len(sequence)` - Returns the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `for element in sequence` - Iterates over each element in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `if element in sequence` - Checks whether the element is part of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sequence[**x**]` - Accesses the element at index [x] of the sequence, starting at zero\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sequence[**x:y**]` - Accesses a slice starting at index [x], ending at index [y-1]. If [x] is omitted, the index will start at 0 by default. If [y] is omitted, the len(sequence) will set the ending index position by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `for index, element in enumerate(sequence)` - Iterates over both the indices and the elements in the sequence at the same time.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `list.remove(x)` - Removes the first occurrence of x in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `list.sort()` - Sorts the items in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `list.reverse()` - Reverses the order of items of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `list.clear()` - Deletes all items in the list.\n",

    "- `list.copy()` - Creates a copy of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `list.extend(other_list)` - Appends all the elements of other_list at the end of list\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map(function, iterable)` - Applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list) and returns a map object with the results\n",
